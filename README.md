# 👋 Hi there, I'm Sai Ganesh Veeravalli

🌍 **Doctoral Researcher | Geospatial Scientist | Remote Sensing Enthusiast**

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently a PhD candidate at **Karlstad University, Sweden**, working on spatial modeling and mapping of **deprived urban areas** as part of the **[DEPRIMAP](https://sola.kau.se/deprimap/)** project. My research blends **GIS, Earth Observation, and Machine Learning** to tackle urban inequality, vulnerability, and environmental change in the Global South.
